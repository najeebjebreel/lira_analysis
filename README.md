This repository provides a **reproducible implementation** of our paper  
***“Revisiting the LiRA Membership Inference Attack Under Realistic Assumptions”***  
(currently **under review** at a peer-reviewed conference).

It re-evaluates the Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA) under **practical training and attack assumptions**, introducing analyses for **realistic threshold calibration**, **skewed membership priors**, and **per-sample reproducibility** of membership inference outcomes.

## Overview

**Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)** test whether a data point was used to train a model.  
**LiRA** is a strong black-box MIA when many shadow models are available (e.g., M=256).  
However, prior work often **overestimated attack success** by:
- Evaluating overconfident models,
- Calibrating thresholds on target data,
- Assuming balanced membership priors,
- Ignoring reproducibility across runs.

This implementation provides a **realistic and reproducible evaluation** of LiRA with:

- **Anti-Overfitting (AOF)** and **Transfer Learning (TL)** target models,  
  preserving accuracy while reducing overconfidence.  
- **Shadow-only threshold calibration** and **precision (PPV)** under realistic priors (π ≤ 10%).  
- **Per-sample reproducibility analysis** across architectures, seeds, and configurations.  

**Key findings:**
- AOF and TL significantly **reduce LiRA’s success** while maintaining model utility.  
- **Shadow-calibrated thresholds** and **skewed priors** substantially lower PPV.  
- **Membership predictions are unstable per sample**; reproducibility requires support-qualified reporting.

## Quick Start

1. **Train Shadow Models (example: CIFAR-10)**

   ```bash
   python train.py --config configs/config_train_image.yaml
   ```

   Trains **256** shadow models and saves artifacts under:
   `experiments/cifar10/resnet18/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM/`

2. **Run LiRA Attack**

   ```bash
   python attack.py --config configs/config_attack.yaml \
     --override experiment.checkpoint_dir=experiments/cifar10/resnet18/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM
   ```

   Runs online, offline, and global variants; saves metrics and ROC curves.

3. **Train and Attack Results** — see [OUTPUTS.md](./OUTPUTS.md)

## Attack Variants

1. **LiRA (Online)** — in/out modeling; strongest with many shadows.
2. **LiRA (Online, Fixed Variance)** — global variance; more stable for small shadow sets.
3. **LiRA (Offline)** — out-only; realistic but weaker.
4. **LiRA (Offline, Fixed Variance)** — simplest offline baseline.
5. **Global Threshold** — single fixed threshold; sanity baseline.
